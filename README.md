# Project Service Without Opened File Repro

Reproduction for my fix to <https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7435>: <https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/7752>.
Shows that removing the `opened` check allows non-program files to be linted properly.

```shell
npm i
npm run lint
```

```plaintext
> lint
> eslint greet.ts vanilla.js
